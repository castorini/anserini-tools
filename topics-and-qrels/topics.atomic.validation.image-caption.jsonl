Painted design featuring water reef scene with people in a boat fishing, 1933 Artist is listed as Percival Albert Trompf and the authorising Government Printer is Frederick Phillips \"Percival Albert Trompf , commercial artist, was born on 30 May 1902 at Beaufort, Victoria Percival joined Giles & Richards, commercial artists in Melbourne, and designed chocolate boxes and wrappings for the confectioners A. W. Allen Pty Ltd. Later, from his studio at Little Collins Street, he painted and designed thousands of advertising posters commissioned by such prominent companies as Bryant & May Pty Ltd and Palmolive Co. Ltd, and by the magazine, Walkabout. His posters for the Australian National Travel Association and the Victorian Government Railways received widespread recognition for their images from nature , but his most popular posters drew upon historical events . His bright, colourful, optimistic pictures had wide appeal, especially during the Depression. Trompf supervised all stages of production, including the printing; most of his posters were 25 ins by 40 ins , but large advertising hoardings required 24 sheets connected in jigsaw fashion.\" Find out more on the life of Percival Trompf from his entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography Creating Agency: Queensland Government Tourist Bureau Queensland State Archives Image ID 22128"}

Shows an energy diagram of n-type semiconductor in contact with redox electrolyte at the left side , and with a metallic ohmic contact at the right side. Ec is the conduction band edge energy, Ev is the valence band energy of the semiconductor. By equilibration of the Fermi level in the semiconductor, EF, and the redox energy of electrolyte, Eredox, a Schottky barrier is formed at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. The vertical size of the barrier in the energy diagram corresponds to the built-in potential Vbi. In the spatial axis the equilibration of Fermi levels produces a space charge region or depletion region of size w. A positive voltage applied to the back contact in raises the Fermi level of electrons EFn, and decreases the size of the depletion region. Consequently, the capacitance of the junction increases, and the reciprocal square capacitance decreases forming a linear Mott\u2013Schottky plot in . The intercept with the x-axis shows the flatband situation, that reveals the built-in potential, depending on the reference of voltage in the electrolyte side. In the presence of a surface state of density Nss, when the Fermi level reaches the bandgap state level, it is discharged and a plateau occurs depending on the value of the Helmholtz layer capacitance CH at the electrolyte side of the junction. When the surface state is charged the Mott\u2013Schottky lines continues, but the flatband potential is modified according to the extend of unpinning of the Fermi level. Adapted from"}

By 1910 its popularity had waned but it proved an ideal location for landing planes and people came from miles around to watch the exploits of famous early fliers such as Gustav Hamel. In 1929 Hull Council bought the land as a municipal airport and on 11th August 1930 Hull's Amy Johnson is said to have landed her plane here to a great reception some three months after her historic solo flight to Australia. Aircraft were built and tested south of the airfield on Hull Road at what later became Airport Garage, until a few years ago the last visible reminder of the aerodrome although that too has now gone. The airfield was requisitioned by the Government at the outbreak of World War 2 but was never again used for flying. In the late 1940's the site was used as a speedway track, something which is reflected in the earthworks shown on 1:25000 scale Ordnance Survey maps, although the outline of these earthworks is not nearly so obvious on the ground. Since then part of the site has been used for household waste disposal and much of it has been used unofficially as a practice ground for offroad motorcycles. The view here is from the southeast corner of the old speedway track, looking across the former airstrip towards St. Augustine's Church in Hedon."}

{"id": "0d97d6f3-a83a-30e5-b04c-76ee550d38c3", "title": "English: The Four Days Fight, 1-4 June 1666 An incident during the second year of the Second Dutch War, 1665-67. It was fought in the southern North Sea between an English fleet of fifty-six ships under the command of the Duke of Albermarle and a larger Dutch fleet commanded by Lieutenant-Admiral Michiel de Ruyter. The 'Four Days Fight', is generally rated a double victory. It was fiercely contested but eventually the English gained the weather position and comparative safety, although large numbers of casualties were incurred on both sides. In the right foreground of the painting an English ship in port-broadside view has burnt almost to the waterline. Beyond the burning ship is a profusion of fighting vessels. On the right, in starboard-quarter view, is the Dutch 'Gouda', 72 guns, commanded by Rear-Admiral Isaac Sweers. She is flying his flag together with that of Lieutenant-Admiral Cornelis Tromp, of the Amsterdam squadron, who was also on board. The 'Gouda' is in action with an English flagship, in starboard-bow view, flying a blue flag with a harp. Beyond and between these two ships is the stern of 'Groot Frisia', 74 guns, commanded by Lieutenant-Admiral Tjerck Hiddes from the Friesland squadron. Engaging her on her starboard bow and shown in starboard-quarter view is Vice-Admiral Abraham van de Hulst's flagship, 'Spiegel', 70 guns, which is also in close action to port with Vice-Admiral Jordan's flagship, the 'Royal Oak', 76 guns, in port-bow view. The Union flag is visible above the smoke of this engagement. There are two unidentifiable private ships on the left of this group with the English one bearing the harp motif on her blue pendants. On the extreme right of the painting, in the background, are two more burning ships, the farthest off being the 'Royal Prince', 85 guns. In the left foreground of the painting is a dismasted English two-decker, in starboard-quarter view, on her beam-ends to port. Although she is sinking, the royal crest carved on her stern is still visible. The artist has carefully detailed the plight of the sailors fleeing the sinking ship and those already in the water. Several small boats are attempting to rescue them and a sailor in the boat in the centre holds out an oar to help a man climb on board. Others are shown floating and holding on to pieces of wreckage. Another English ship, in starboard-broadside view, is in flames and beyond her a third ship, in starboard-quarter view, is sinking in the centre middle distance. To her left in a concentration of shipping, the stern of de Ruyter's flagship, 'Zeven Provincien', 86 guns, in starboard-quarter view, is shown. Nearer to the viewer and on the extreme left of the painting is Vice-Admiral William Berkeley's 'Swiftsure', 64 guns, in starboard-bow view. This is engaged on both sides by ships of the Zeeland squadron, with Lieutenant-Admiral Cornelis Evertsen senior, in the 'Walcheren', 68 guns, on the left and Vice-Admiral Adrianne Banckert in the 'Tholen', 60 guns, on the right. It is possible that this signed painting was a commission from Abraham van de Hulst. The artist worked in Amsterdam, where he was burgomaster in 1642. He may have trained with the marine artist Claes Claesz Wou, , and is best known for panoramic battle scenes from the time of the Second Dutch War. The painting is inscribed 'P.van Soest'. The Four Days' Battle, 1-4 June 1666. Note: Spiegel's transom has a carving of two angels holding a mirror, Spiegel . Built in 1663."}

Around the corner on the red carpet, news media waited for the celebs. The name listed included Jennifer Hawkins and Jake Wall, Kate Richie and Stuart Webb, Wendell Sailor and wife Tara, Ricki-Lee Coulter and boyfriend Richard Harrison. Does anyone know how much the celebs are getting paid to turn up to Star invites, or is it just a win - win, all done to generate positive media buzz? Finally, after what seemed like hours for Russell Crowe and beautiful wife, Danielle Spencer did the red, fresh off dinner at the revamped casino aka integrated entertainment complex. For the record, Stevie Wonder did not do the red carpet. Promoters across Australia, if not the world, are attempting to find out how much money Mr Wonder is making for his intimate appearances at The Star, and that's likely to be something that is kept well under wraps for a while yet. The Star may be a bit of a media darling at the moment, but nothing lasts forever. The Star would do well to go out of their way to also impress news media who have been quite supportive of the Echo Entertainment owned complex, since they first announced it was going to get a massive makeover. We've heard that the next trump card for more news headlines will be the official opening of The Darling, the 5 star boutique lifestyle hotel and spa. Just how long it may take The Star to recoup its almost billion dollar casino revamp investment is unknown, but Echo Entertainment looks to be in this for the long haul, so good on them.

People on the tow path are pulling on a rope attached to the aircraft. This was both the last and the largest of Cody's aircraft and was intended to take part in the Daily Mail Coastal Circuit of Britain contest. This competition was to begin in August 1913 from Calshot near Southampton following the south and east coast to Inverness down the Caledonian canal to the west coast, across the Irish sea to Dublin, round Land's End to Falmouth and then returning to Southampton all to be done within 72 hours. The aircraft was again a biplane with a single frontal elevator and a single triangular rudder with horizontal appendage held on two spars so as to accommodate the large four bladed propeller in a pusher Configuration. There was a large central float one and two smaller ones beneath the wings level with the front elevator spars all of which were made by Harmsworth of the nearby Ash Vale Boathouse. Whilst the floats were fitted to the aircraft for buoyancy testing it never flew with them fitted. Cody made numerous flights in the aircraft fitted with the conventional undercarriage including a demonstration for the army of the aircraft as an ambulance plane. Despite the aircraft's size the 100 hp Green engine meant it was relatively fast and handled well with Cody confident that he could win the race for which there were only three other entries. However on the 7th August 1913 Cody and W H B Evans were killed when the aircraft broke up whilst he was returning to land at Laffan's Plain."}

The obverse of the bulla contains the legend */InnO/CEnTIVS/PP.VII within a border of pellets, PP standing for 'Pastor Pastorum' or 'Shepherd of Shepherds'. On the reverse can be seen depictions of Saints Peter and Paul beneath an inscription reading SPASPE . St. Paul is seen on the left of the seal looking right, with a long pointed beard, while St. Peter is on the right facing left and has a rounded face with beard and hair formed of pellets. Both faces are contained within beaded borders and separated from one another by a crozier. Like the obverse type, the reverse has a border of pellets. This example measures 36.37mm in diameter, 5.66mm in thickness, and weighs 45.65g. Papal bullae such as this would have acted as seals on official Papal documents to authenticate their provenance and authority."}

English: Oosterboschite, Trogtalite, Cuprosklodowskite, Quartz Locality: Musonoi Mine, Kolwezi, Kolwezi District, Katanga Copper Crescent, Katanga , Democratic Republic of Congo Size: 4.2 x 2.9 x 2.3 cm Oosterboschite and trogtalite are very rare selenides, with the former having palladium and copper and the latter having cobalt. The famed Musonoi is the Type Locality for Oosterboschite. This piece is from the Howard Belsky Collection, who collected many rare species. We believe the splendent gray crystals on one end surrounded by a green mineral are the oosterboschite. The quartz matrix holds several vugs richly lined with gemmy, green cuprosklowdoskite needles. The brown crystals richly lining one vug could be oxidized trogtalite, as MINDAT lists this species as being rose-violet. X-ray work would be needed to confirm species identifications in a normal case but, as this is from the Belsky Collection, it's pretty certain to be legitimate. He had his own analytical setup and did much work with friends in museums, specializing in rarities. Deutsch: Oosterboschit, Trogtalit, Cuprosklodowskit, Quarz Fundort: Musonoi Mine, Kolwezi, Kolwezi Distrikt, Katanga Kupfersichel, Katanga , Demokratische Republik Kongo Gr\u00f6\u00dfe: 4,2 x 2,9 x 2,3 cm Oosterboschit und Trogtalit sind sehr seltene Selenide, wobei ersteres Palladium und Kupfer und letzteres Cobalt enth\u00e4lt. Die ber\u00fchmte Lagerst\u00e4tte Musonoi ist die Typlokalit\u00e4t f\u00fcr Oosterboschit. Dieses St\u00fcck stammt aus der Sammlung von Howard Belsky, der viele seltene Arten sammelte. Wir glauben, dass die grauen, von einem gr\u00fcnen Mineral umgebenen Kristalle an einem Ende aus Oosterboschit bestehen. Die Quarz-Matrix enth\u00e4lt gr\u00fcne Cuprosklowdoskit-Nadeln als Drusenf\u00fcllung. Eine weitere Drusenf\u00fcllung mit braunen Kristalle k\u00f6nnte aus oxidiertem Trogtalit bestehen. Bei Mindat wird diese Spezies als rosa-violett beschrieben. Im Normalfall w\u00e4re eine R\u00f6ntgenstrukturanalyse n\u00f6tig, um die Mineralarten dieser Probe zu best\u00e4tigen. Da diese jedoch aus der Belsky Sammlung stammt, sind die Angaben zur Probe vertrauensw\u00fcrdig. Belsky hatte seine eigene analytische Einrichtung und arbeitete zudem viel mit Freunden in Museen zusammen, die auf Rarit\u00e4ten spezialisiert waren."}

This flickering swarm of cosmic fireflies is a rich cluster of galaxies called Abell 2163. Abell 2163 is a member of the Abell catalogue, an all-sky catalogue of over 4000 galaxy clusters. It is particularly well-studied because the material sitting at its core exhibits exceptional properties, including a large and bright radio halo and extraordinarily high temperatures and X-ray luminosities. It is the hottest cluster in the catalogue! Observing massive clusters like Abell 2163 can contribute to the study of dark matter, and provide a new perspective on the distant Universe via phenomena such as gravitational lensing. This image was taken by Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys and Wide-Field Camera 3, partially for an extensive observing programme called RELICS. The programme is imaging 41 massive galaxy clusters to find the brightest distant galaxies, which will be studied in more detail using both current telescopes and the future NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope ."}

The left-hand panel depicts her vision of the Madonna and Child: the Christ Child did not find Catherine worthy because she wasn't baptised and refused to look at her. The middle scene illustrates her baptism. The right-hand panel presents her second vision of the Madonna and Child: as a baptised Christian she is now worthy in Christ's eyes and she is joined to him in a mystic marriage. The delicate figures reflect the continuing influence of the International Gothic style. Swabian painters of the following generation developed a more harsly realistic style. ."}

Both have the same basic letter structure but Old Standard is much more spindly with finer serifs, especially in italic. The captions are in Yamaoka Yasuhiro's Moderno, which isn't particularly historically appropriate, but I thought it has the same feel. It's based on the structure of Bodoni and resembles period engraving a bit."}

Most oil is trucked out daily from each well, causing a massive amount of semi truck traffic in the county. Little oil moves in the winter. Natural gas pipelines exist, but are at capacity. So natural gas is usually flared off year round. There are attempts to build natural gas piplines throughout the county, to capture the gas. But even so, there is no compressing facility nearby which would allow the gas to be sweetened and liquified and moved nationwide. There is one currently under construction as of July 2013."}

Here the nasal chondrocytes are isolated by enzymatic digestion of the cartilage biopsy, expanded and cultured onto collagen membrane to engineer cartilage grafts . Throughout the graft manufacturing phase regular sterility controls are performed. At the end of manufacturing, quality control tests are performed for the release of the grafts.

English: NASA's Galileo spacecraft provides a new view of this heavily cratered region in the southern hemisphere of the icy Jovian satellite Callisto. The region was not observed by NASA's Voyager spacecraft. Craters ranging in diameter from the 1.85 kilometer limit of resolution up to more than 70 kilometers can be observed in this image. Although all craters are generally round in outline, details in their structures vary with both size and relative age. Bright spots in the center of smaller craters (up to approximately 20 kilometers ) are central peaks. Larger craters (up to the 51 kilometer wide crater in the east central part of the image) exhibit central pits or depressions. The largest crater, called Thrainn, has a diameter of 74 kilometers and is located in the southernmost corner of the image. This crater contains a broad central uplift, or dome, and has a highly eroded rim. In contrast, the 70 kilometer crater Audr, located along the northern margin of the image, is flat-bottomed, and has a less degraded and generally rounder rim. If erosional or degradational forces have been roughly constant with time on Callisto, scientists viewing this image can assume that Audr is relatively younger than Thrainn by noting the less degraded or fresher appearance of its rim. The differences in crater floor features between these two similarly sized craters could have been produced by differences in the impacting bodies that produced them, differences in the crustal materials in which the craters formed, or simply by a gradual evolution of crater floor shape with time."}

The letter, a Hebrew-language recommendation written on behalf of one member of their community, was part of an enormous collection brought to Cambridge by Solomon Schechter from the Cairo Geniza. It was discovered in 1962 during a survey of the Geniza documents by Norman Golb of the University of Chicago. The letter is dated by most scholars to around 930 CE."}

Led by two gunmen better known by their aliases, Butch Cassidy and Kid Curry , the Wild Bunch was an informal trust of thieves and rustlers that preyed upon stagecoaches, small banks, and especially railroads from the late 1880s to the first decade of the twentieth century. This crudely constructed tintype portrait of five members of the gang dressed in bowler hats and city clothes shows, clockwise, from the top left, Kid Curry, Bill McCarty, Bill Carver, Ben Kilpatrick, and Tom O'Day. Without their six shooters and cowboy hats the outlaws appear quite civilized and could easily be mistaken for the sheriffs and Pinkerton agents who pursued them in a \"Wild West\" already much tamed by the probable date of this photograph. Gone was the open range--instead, homesteads and farms dotted the landscape and barbed-wire fences frustrated the cattleman's drive to market. Gone too was the anonymity associated with distance, as the camera and the telegraph conspired to identify criminals. Bank and train robbery were still lucrative, but the outlaw's chances for escape gradually shifted in favor of the sheriff's chances for arrest and conviction. By 1903 the Wild Bunch had disbanded. A few members of the gang followed Butch Cassidy to South America, while the majority remained in the West, trying to avoid capture. McCarty was shot dead in 1893, in a street in Delta, Colorado, after a bank robbery; Carver died in prison; Kilpatrick was killed during a train robbery in 1912; Tom O'Day was captured by a Casper, Wyoming, sheriff in 1903; and Kid Curry died either by his own hand in Parachute, Colorado, in 1904, or, as legend has it, lived until he was killed by a wild mule in South America in 1909. The photograph comes from the collection of Camillus S. Fly, a pioneer photographer in Tombstone, Arizona, in the 1880s and sheriff of Cochise County in the 1890s."}

This model is based on reactions of DNA and RecBCD with ATP in excess over Mg2+ ions. Step 1: RecBCD binds to a double-stranded DNA end. Step 2: RecBCD unwinds DNA. RecD is a fast helicase on the 5'-ended strand, and RecB is a slower helicase on the 3'-ended strand . This produces two single-stranded DNA tails and one ss loop. The loop and tails enlarge as RecBCD moves along the DNA. Step 3: The two tails anneal to produce a second ss DNA loop, and both loops move and grow. Step 4: Upon reaching the Chi hotspot sequence RecBCD nicks the 3'-ended strand. Further unwinding produces a long 3'-ended ss tail with Chi near its end. Step 5: RecBCD loads RecA protein onto the Chi tail. At some undetermined point, the RecBCD subunits disassemble. Step 6: The RecA-ssDNA complex invades an intact homologous duplex DNA to produce a D-loop, which can be resolved into intact, recombinant DNA in two ways. Step 7: The D-loop is cut and anneals with the gap in the first DNA to produce a Holliday junction. Resolution of the Holliday junction at the open arrowheads by some combination of RuvABC and RecG produces two recombinants of reciprocal type. Step 8: The 3' end of the Chi tail primes DNA synthesis, from which a replication fork can be generated. Resolution of the fork at the open arrowheads produces one recombinant DNA, one parental-type DNA, and one DNA fragment. Figure 2 RecBCD pathway of homologous recombination where ATP is in excess."}

Pixel geometries for LCD display: subpixels are arranged with patterns alternating rows with RBG and GBR order. This is one of the alternative layouts to classic RGB layouts, that allows increasing the horizontal resolution of black and white vertical stripes without creating color fringes . With a classic RGB or BGR layout, the thinest and fringeless B&W stripes must use white strokes covering all three subpixels equally, creating a pattern whose width is 6 subpixels. With this layout, it is possible to display both the black and the white stripe within 1.5 subpixel each, i.e. a total of 3 subpixels for the 2 vertical strokes, in two possible configurations, such as: the vertical white strokes on a black background will fully illuminate a red and green row, and half-illuminate the blue pixels on each side ; the vertical black strokes will leave the next red or green column black and will half-darken the blue pixels on each side. This layout would be ideal for small LCD panels of smartphones, where the pixel density cannot be easily increased to keep a good contrast , where the total resolution is necessarily limited as well as the distance of observation which makes the individual pixels more visible. This layout is currently experimental as it is still not supported by ClearType and Quartz subpixel renderings used in Windows and MacOS X. Note that the blue subpixels are vertically aligned and could still potentially produce bue color fringes, but choosing blue is preferable as it is the pigment that contributes the least to the visual intensity. Due to current lack of software support for this layout in current display and graphics libraries, very few LCD screens have been produced for computer display."}

And so, I anticipated that what Claudius Ptolemy had observed of the all the latitudes must be subject to reason for all longitudes, not only in the parallel described through Rhodes or Thule, but plainly for all. That way, I maintain, many kinds of outlines were generated by me as known from reason, among which is the one marked out here which, when copies were made by friends it was loudly demanded of me by them, as it were daily, that it be sent to the public, and I had no reluctance to oblige them if they could obtain for me certainty regarding the Western lands. It came to pass then, that when the Divine Invincible Charles V, Emperor of the Romans and forever August, revisited Cologne that, among other things, as to whether the confines of Newfoundland, Florida, New Spain and America adjoined the Oriental lands, was referred to his most distinguished Spanish experts who were gathered together in friendship, but there was none of them who could correctly pronounce on this, with the sole exception of the Emperor, to whom descriptions of the said newly discovered lands and islands were daily sent from New Spain. But then, thinking on what happened , His Majesty Caesar, upon investigating when mention was made of those lands, among other things gave his response that the aforesaid lands by no means appeared to be cloven apart by the sea, but were joined to the oriental lands. Further, the Spanish had made voyages again and again from Tenochtitlan the famous city of the Great Khan Emperor, otherwise known as King Montezuma, westward in search of the lands referred to, and no limit to such expanses could be found; suffice to say that he declared the land that fell to the region of Serica, which includes the people of China, was certainly found to be contained within the Spanish limits, of which convincing proof came from the Indians with whom the invincible Hernan Cortes had carried on war in New Spain. Furthermore, these arrangements will not be reached here but will be brought to light in their time in whichever place the book of Cosmography gives. Therefore, Dear Reader, what was communicated to me by Caesar's Majesty, and which I studiously communicate to you, clearly as I was told, and offer on my elbow to you as an interim gift, that you will receive with approval what I accepted, for us to enjoy as first fruits until I shall have published another representative description in the shape of a human heart."}

Both objects, captured here by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope are found in the constellation of Sagittarius and lie 15 000 light-years away. The star Hen 2-427 shines brightly at the very centre of this explosive image and around the hot clumps of gas that are ejected into space at over 150 000 kilometres per hour. Hen 2-427 is a Wolf\u2013Rayet star, named after the astronomers Charles Wolf and Georges Rayet. Wolf\u2013Rayet are super-hot stars characterised by a fierce ejection of mass. The nebula M1-67 is estimated to be no more than 10 000 years old \u2014 just a baby in astronomical terms \u2014 but what a beautiful and magnificent sight it makes.

Both ecological selection pressures and selection to avoid intrinsic incompatibilities mould hybrid genomes. Depending on the balance between beneficial alleles and incompatibilities hybridisation can result either in an admixed taxon that is reproductively isolated from both parent taxa, or local introgression into a taxon that remains distinct in spite of occasional gene flow. RI abbreviates reproductive isolation. Fd is estimated between a hybrid population and the red parent species, and the haplotypes illustrate example individuals in these populations."}

Das klassizistische Schloss von 1806 ist ber\u00fchmt f\u00fcr die Weing\u00fcter ringsum. Geschichtl. Abriss: Im Jahr 1690 verlieh Gustav Adolf Herzog von Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow den Besitz an Georg-Henning von Oertzen. Die Familie konnte den Besitz aber erst ab 1775 nach dem Erl\u00f6schen der Familie Manteuffel im m\u00e4nnlichen Stamm f\u00fcr sich nutzen. In diesem Jahr \u00fcbernahm Victor-Wilhelm von Oertzen den Besitz. Sein Sohn, Hans-Christoph von Oertzen lie\u00df 1806 das Herrenhaus, einen zweigeschossigen Putzbau im klassizistischen Stil, auf den Fundamenten eines \u00e4lteren Geb\u00e4udes, errichten. Das Herrenhaus Rattey wurde zum Ende des 2. Weltkrieges durch die Familie von Oertzen an die Gemeinde verkauft. Die Familie verlie\u00df Mecklenburg nach dem gescheiterten Hitler-Attentat, an dem Hans-Ulrich von Oertzen ma\u00dfgeblich beteiligt war. Nach dem Krieg zogen vorerst Fl\u00fcchtlinge in das Geb\u00e4ude ein, sp\u00e4ter wurden die R\u00e4ume auch durch einen Kindergarten, die Post und die LPG-K\u00fcche genutzt. Im Jahr 1996 erwarben zwei Bremer Unternehmer das Herrenhaus und renovierten es von Grund auf. Seit 1998 wird hier ein Hotel gef\u00fchrt. Bekannt wurde Rattey auch als n\u00f6rdlichstes Weinanbaugebiet Deutschlands. Im Park stehen 13 Eichen, deren Alter auf mindestens 700 Jahre gesch\u00e4tzt wird."}

English: Pattadakal was an early medieval era seat of coronation of the Chalukyan Kings of South Indian Hindu kingdoms. The site is located in Karnataka, and contain the surviving collection of temples and artwork from the 7th-9th centuries CE, sponsored particularly the Chalukya and Rashtrakuta dynasties. These temples are of historic significance as they display a fusion of architectural styles found in northern and southern parts of the Indian subcontinent. The site, temples and its religious importance is mentioned in more ancient Hindu texts, as Kisuvolal , Pattada-Kisuvolal or as Raktapura , but except for excavated parts the evidence of earlier temples has not survived. In later era texts, the Pattadakal location is also referred to as Petirgal, Pattasilapura or Hammirapura suggesting that the site remained culturally important over a long period. The Pattadakal monuments included in the UNESCO world heritage site consist of nine Hindu temples and one Jain temple. These were built near the left bank of the Malaprabha river where it turns northward towards the Himalayas, considered auspicious in ancient India. The temples are relatively younger group of monuments, the older ones are found in Aihole and Badami less than 50 kilometer distance which predate these by a few centuries. The temples are important not only for their architecture and layout, but for their carvings and artist inscriptions which provide evidence of Hindu and Jaina theology, arts, culture and society between the 7th and 9th century. While the temples and artwork show signs of systematic defacement and damage, much has survived. One Hindu temple in the group of monument remains active. The Pattadakal group is one of many clusters of historic temples in Pattadakal area, but most of the other clusters are not a part of the UNESCO designation. The Pattadakal temples show two major style types. The south Indian dravida vimana type is displayed in the Virupaksha, Mallikarjuna and Sangameswara temples. The north Indian rekhanagara prasada type is displayed by the Kadasiddeswara, Jambulinga, Galaganatha, Kashivishweswara and Papanatha temples. But some temples experiment a fusion of the two styles. The Sangameswara temple is the best example of dravida vimana type. The Virupaksha temple of 8th century is the best example of the fruits of creative fusion in terms of the plan, style and integration of arts."}

This was, I think, the main entrance to Deep Navigation Colliery in Treharris. At the time this picture was taken, the pit was idle during the prolonged industrial dispute. Many individuals and groups tried to support the local community during the dispute with donations of food and necessities, etc. Looking back, there can be few who do not see the ending of coal production at the pit as anything but a disaster for the whole community. The pit has now disappeared, and new streets and some housing have been built in its place. See 754972 and 755541 and 755549 for Chris Allen's pictures of the colliery as it was. \"Deep Navigation Colliery was situated near Treharris in the Taff Bargoed Valley. In 1878 two shafts were sunk at the site which were, at the time, the deepest pits in the south Wales coalfield. During this period the mine was called Harris' Navigation Colliery after the name of the principal shareholder, F.W. Harris. The same man also gave his name to the neighbouring village of Treharris. In 1893, the Colliery was purchased by the Ocean Coal Co. Ltd. who changed its name to Deep Navigation Colliery. The Colliery produced high quality steam coal which was greatly in demand notably by Cunard Steamlines. Deep Navigation became the sole source of the coal used for the record-breaking trans-Atlantic crossings of both the SS Mauretania and the SS Lusitania. Another important event was the construction of the first ever pit head baths in the south Wales coalfield in 1916. Upon Nationalisation in 1947, the Colliery was placed into the National Coal Boards South Western Division No. 4 Area, Group No. 4. Deep Navigation was the subject of heavy investment and reorganisation during the 1960s but remained in production until March 1991.\" Source: Ray Lawrence, The South Wales Coalfield Directory, Vol. 2 , p. 191 See _URL_"}

English: A Kandahar \"bear trap\" binding, used by the US 10th Mountain Division during WWII. The boot is held in place primarily by the angular metal clip at the toe. The leather strap running through the clip holds the boot down and back, holding it in the clip. In order to keep the boot from sliding out of the clip to the rear, a cable runs down the side of the boot to the long spring-like metal strap running around the heel area and over the back of the sole of the boot. The spring strap allows the length of the cable to change when the skier strides, which requires the heel of the boot to lift off the ski, pivoting at the toe. Just off-frame to the right is a lever that is used to tension the cable assembly and provide enough forward force to keep the boot held firm in the clip. This example is missing one feature of most \"Kandahar\"-style bindings, a second metal clip near the heel that the cable can be clipped into to prevent the heel rising off the ski. This is used while skiing downhill and then released to return to cross-country striding."}

This painting, according to the Royal Academy catalogue, is set on the pass in the Black Mountains, Glenorchy Forest, and a more recent source, G.K. Whitehead in 'The Deer Stalking Grounds of Great Britain and Ireland', pinpoints the scene to the high pass between the corries of Altchaorum and Larig Dochard. When the deer were driven here the pass could be covered by two rifles. Whitehead also states that the hounds that are portrayed in the painting were the two best ever owned by Lord Breadalbane and that the painting records a specific occasion when Landseer went stalking on Black Mount. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert stayed with Lord Breadalbane at Taymouth Castle in 1842. In 1873, when the commemorative exhibition of Landseer's work was being organised at the Royal Academy, this painting was described as 'the picture which would do the greatest honour to poor Sir Edwin'. The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1847. Provenance Bought by Prince Albert. _URL_"}

It was developed as an air-to-air weapon by the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics in World War II. With a range of 18 miles, the Gorgon II-A utilized a television guidance system to locate the target and was controlled by radio signals. Only 21 Gorgon II-A's were built and flight tested during 1945-1946. This is one of the few surviving examples. The Gorgon was also one of America's first attempts to use television in guided missiles for target tracking although the TV transmissions were weak. The missile's rocket motor produced 350 pounds of thrust. The program was cancelled in 1946."}

Texas Long Leaf Lumber Company, which started at Willard in 1912, bought Thompson Brothers' Trinity mill in 1922. Under management of Paul Sanderson for 22 years, the company was one of the nation's most successful manufacturers of Yellow Pine and Southern Hardwoods. Working with forest landowners in Texas, Sanderson promoted selected cutting, reforestation, fire protection and removal of defective trees. By 1937 the mill was producing 3.5 million board feet monthly. The commercial species of lumber cut were Long Leaf, Short Leaf, and Loblolly Pine, Oak, Gum, Ash, Magnolia, and various other woods. The main office of Texas Long Leaf Lumber Company was the 205 acre mill site in Trinity, with additional sales offices in Houston and St. Louis. The company was one of Trinity's largest employers, with as many as 450 employees. During World War II, production reached 140,000 board feet daily, resulting in lumber flown to Europe and Africa and the awarding of the Army-Navy \"E\" Award in a March 17, 1944, ceremony in Trinity. Sanderson turned to a widespread public campaign for postwar planning and perpetuation of the timber industry in Texas with emphasis on timber as a renewable natural resource. At the time of his untimely death in October 1944, Sanderson held many Civic and Lumber Industry Offices, including President of the Southern Pine Association, President of the Texas Forest Association and Chairman of the Texas Prison Board. In 1953, Texas Long Leaf Timber interests totaled 252,230 acres in six East Texas counties. The closing of the mill in 1955 had a devastating impact on the local economy and ended a long chapter in the history of the community. The base of the Historical Marker includes bricks from \"The Old Mill\"."}

Irregular stone house in Charlevoix, Michigan Try a walking tour of the mushroom houses of the late Charlevoix real estate developer Earl Young. The best way to describe them: Think about the digs of Hansel and Gretel. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Little Red Riding Hood's grandma. Buyers snap up these unusual homes as soon as they go on the market. They have a distinctive charm that have made them a sought-after commodity and a special tourist attraction. Young, at 5-feet-4, loved the cozy cottages in the rural areas of Great Britain. From the 1920s-1970s, he transferred these images to Charlevoix and built, without plans, many homes and several commercial buildings, including the Weathervane Terrace Hotel. The Ice Age boulders of the Great Lakes region were his favorite building material. They became his signature, along with the wavy, overhanging shingled roofs he used. These give the smaller homes a mushroom-like shape. \"My name for them is 'Early Mother Goose,\" says Charlevoix architect Jack Begrow, a friend of Young's who sometimes remodels and enlarges the homes for present-day owners. \"Earl used to bury certain boulders he found so no one would take them before he could use them,\" Begrow says. \"He'd create the houses as he went along, just pacing off the rooms to the builder.\" Young died in 1975. The largest concentration of his work is Boulder Park, a development of vacation homes near Lake Michigan. Some of his most imaginative houses are on Park Street, and his own, a spacious multilevel structure is on Clinton Street."}

Wearing rear-admiral's undress uniform 1787-95, and the ribbon and star of the Bath, the former worn inside his coat. The background has been painted as sky. In 1795, he was put in command of the British Mediterranean fleet, and in 1797, with Nelson as his commodore, led his forces to victory over a Spanish fleet off Cape St Vincent. Jervis was created Earl St Vincent in recognition of this achievement and he later became First Lord of the Admiralty, 1801-04. The sitter and the artist became friends and this is reflected in the directness, warmth and intimacy of this portrait, particularly notable since Jervis had a public reputation as a strict disciplinarian. The artist trained as a lawyer before entering the Royal Academy Schools, London, in 1772, where he may have studied with Johan Zoffany. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1776, and throughout his career he produced competent portraits since he had no shortage of clients. In 1793, he was named portrait painter to Queen Charlotte and undertook a number of royal commissions. His straightforward style perfectly suited the stolid and conventional taste of the Royal family. In 1795, John Opie described Beechey's pictures as 'of that mediocre quality as to taste & fashion, that they seemed only fit for sea captains & merchants'."}

The same day, Reuters reported that the storm had claimed six lives, forced thousands of residents into shelters, and destroyed thousands of huts. Despite the damage, the toll was less severe than feared in Bangladesh and Burma, where thousands of displaced people were already living in flood-prone camps. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on NASA's Aqua satellite captured this natural-color image the day that Mahasen came ashore. Clouds stretched across Bangladesh, northeastern India, and northwestern Burma. In its final warning for Mahasen, the U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center reported that the storm had maximum sustained winds of 45 knots and gusts up to 55 knots , but was dissipating over land."}

This is an ancient marsh of about 20 hectares, a fragment of what was once a much larger wetland. It is famous as being the place in Belfast where the increasingly rare corncrake was last heard in the early 1990s. Its preservation has in large part been due to the efforts of a local pressure group 'The Friends of Bog Meadows', formed in 1989. It contains traditionally grazed meadows, open pond areas and woodland scrub and is now managed by the Ulster Wildlife Trust. Belfast City Council designated the site as a Local Nature Reserve, one of only three such sites in Northern Ireland."}

Late indian summer in 2014, I was lucky to travel 2 months around in South-Italy and Sicily. Most attracting places were lonely as the holiday season ended and you could meet only few people on coast lines. We really enjoyed the meditative but warm autumn days closed to the nature. On the technical side, this is one of my first experiments with luminosity masks. 3 exposures have been blended into this final image. Handling dynamic range of light by luminosity masks is a challenging post-processing technique which opens up endless possibilities for landscape photographers. Instead of tone-mapping HDR softwares, by applying luminosity masking a photographer can recover the realistic and natural look that has been experienced while shooting in high dynamic range of lights conditions."}

These included belladona, digitalis, liquorice and peppermint. The factory also milled imported ginger and pepper, a variety of gums and other spices, and made food flavouring essences and naturally-based insecticides such as pyrethrum and derris. The business flourished, and the association with the Allen family has continued for a hundred years. It is now \"Bush Boake Allen\" and until 2002 made the most wonderful smells in the village street when the wind was in the right direction!

The gastropods are a group of molluscs that occupy marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments. Most gastropods have a calcareous external shell . Some lack a shell completely, or have reduced internal shells . Most members of the Gastropoda are marine. Most marine snails are herbivores or predators/carnivores. Shown above is one of the more bizarre gastropod shells around - this is Vermicularia, also called a worm snail. It's one of the few snails that does not have a tightly coiled shell. Several snails from different families have shells somewhat like this . They all resemble the twisted mineralized shells made by some annelid worms, hence the common name \"worm snails\" or \"worm shells\". Despite the superficially very different-looking shells, malacologists have demonstrated that Vermicularia is very closely related to the high-spired snail Turritella . Juvenile Vermicularia are free living, infaunal filter feeders that position themselves apex-down and aperture-up within the sediment. During this stage in ontogeny, the Vermicularia shell is tightly coiled, as is any ordinary gastropod shell. Later in life, the snail becomes an epifaunal, encrusting filter feeder , and its shell starts uncoiling. The advantage of an uncoiled shell in Vermicularia is generally inferred to be rapid upright growth . If hard or firm substrates aren't available, Vermicularia generally doesn't grow an unwound shell during growth, and it ends up looking like typical a Turritella shell. The degree of uncoiling also depends on the nature of the hard substrate . So, shell uncoiling is an ecophenotypic character. Classification: Animalia, Mollusca, Gastropoda, Turritellidae Provenance: marine beach from near the southern end of Cayo Costa Island, southwestern Florida, USA Most info. synthesized from Morton and Gould : Morton - Vermicularia and the turritellids.

High metaphase promoting factor activity causes mammalian oocytes to arrest at the metaphase II stage until fertilization by a sperm. The fertilization event causes intracellular calcium oscillations, and targeted degradation of cyclin B, a regulatory subunit of MPF, thus permitting the MII-arrested oocyte to proceed through meiosis. To initiate parthenogenesis of swine oocytes, various methods exist to induce an artificial activation that mimics sperm entry, such as calcium ionophore treatment, microinjection of calcium ions, or electrical stimulation. Treatment with cycloheximide, a non-specific protein synthesis inhibitor, enhances parthenote development in swine presumably by continual inhibition of MPF/cyclin B. As meiosis proceeds, extrusion of the second polar is blocked by exposure to cytochalasin B. This treatment results in a diploid parthenote. Parthenotes can be surgically transferred to a recipient oviduct for further development, but will succumb by developmental failure after \u224830 days of gestation. The swine parthenote placentae often appears hypo-vascular and is approximately 50% smaller than biparental offspring placentae: see free image in linked reference."}

The storm produced heavy rainfall in Sri Lanka, leading to flash flooding and a large loss of life there. The total rain accumulation, exceeding nine inches, is shown in the false-color image above. The rain accumulation map was produced using the TRMM-based, near-real-time Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. In this image, note the huge rainfall footprint produced by Tropical Cyclone 01B as it intensified over the Bay of Bengal. At first, it would appear that the isolated rainfall pocket located over Sri Lanka bears little relation to the burgeoning tropical storm. However, there is evidence to suggest that the rainstorms that deluged Sri Lanka were associated with an outer \"feeder band\" of moisture entering the tropical cyclone from the southwest. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission features a spaceborne weather radar built by the Japanese space agency NASDA. In operation for five years, TRMM has provided unprecedented views of tropical rain events around the globe, and now also provides information on flash flood potential ."}

Morisot, an original member of the group, showed in seven of its eight exhibitions and contributed financially to sustain the impressionist movement. The Mother and Sister of the Artist, one of Morisot's largest works, was exhibited at the Salon of 1870 and perhaps again in 1874 at the first impressionist exhibition. The painting, a family portrait and an intimate domestic genre scene, was begun when Morisot's sister Edma Pontillon stayed with her family in the winter of 1869-1870 to await the birth of her first child, a pregnancy discreetly disguised by Edma's loose white morning robe. Anxious about sending the painting to the Salon, Morisot solicited Manet's advice, and on the last day for submissions he visited the Morisot home. Morisot's correspondence reveals that, rather than offer verbal suggestions, Manet extensively repainted the figure of the artist's mother. Manet's suave shorthand, seen in the mother's features and black dress, differs obviously from the nervous refinement of Morisot's touch in her sister's features, the floral upholstery, and the reflections in the mirror over Edma's head."}

Supernova SN 2012 near nucleus of the galaxy English: An unusual new video sequence shows the rapid brightening and slower fading of a supernova explosion in the galaxy NGC 1365. The supernova, which has been named SN 2012fr, was discovered by French astronomer Alain Klotz on the 27 October 2012. The images captured by the small TAROT robotic telescope, located at ESO's La Silla Observatory in Chile, have been compiled to create this unique movie. Supernovae are the results of the explosive and cataclysmic deaths of certain types of stars. They are so brilliant that they can outshine their entire parent galaxy for many weeks before slowly fading from sight. The supernova 2012fr was discovered by Alain Klotz on the afternoon of 27 October 2012. He was busy measuring the brightness of a faint variable star in an image from the TAROT robotic telescope at ESO's La Silla Observatory, when he noticed a new object that was not present in an image taken three days earlier. After checking with telescopes and astronomers all across the world the bright object was confirmed to be a Type Ia supernova. Some stars co-habit with a second star, both orbiting around a common centre of gravity. In some cases one of them might be a very old white dwarf that is stealing material from its companion. At some point the white dwarf has siphoned off so much matter from its companion that it becomes unstable and explodes. This is known as a Type Ia supernova. This kind of supernova has become very important as they are the most reliable way of measuring distances to very remote galaxies in the early Universe. Beyond the local group of galaxies, astronomers needed to find very bright objects with predictable properties that could act as signposts to help them map out the expansion history of the Universe. Type Ia supernovae are ideal as their brightnesses peak and fade in almost the same way for each explosion. Measurements of the distances to Type Ia supernovae led to the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe, work that was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2011. The host galaxy of this supernova is NGC 1365, an elegant barred spiral galaxy, located 60 million light-years away towards the constellation of Fornax . With its diameter of about 200 000 light-years, it stands out among the other galaxies in the Fornax cluster. A colossal straight bar runs through the galaxy, containing the nucleus at the centre. The new supernova can be easily spotted just above the core, in the middle of the image. Astronomers discovered more than 200 new supernovae in 2012, of which SN 2012fr is among the brightest. The supernova was first spotted when it was very faint on the 27 October 2012, and it reached its peak brightness on 11 November 2012 . It was then easily seen as a faint star through a medium-sized amateur telescope. The video was compiled from a series of images taken of the galaxy over a period of three months, from the discovery in October until mid-January 2013. TAROT is a 25-centimetre optical robotic telescope, able to move very fast, and to start an observation within a second. It was installed at La Silla Observatory in 2006 with the purpose of detecting cosmic gamma-ray bursts. The images that revealed SN 2012fr were captured using blue, green and red filters. Notes: Supernovae are designated by the year in which they are discovered, and the order in which they are discovered during that year, by using letters of the alphabet. The fact that the the supernova was discovered by a French team and it has been designated by the letters \"fr\" is pure coincidence. At this time it was magnitude 11.9. This is about 200 times too faint to see with the unaided eye even on a clear and dark night. But if the supernova at its peak brightness and our star the Sun were seen together at the same distance from the observer the supernova would appear about 3000 million times brighter than the Sun.

English: In an era when most youngsters are turning towards materialism and western music, Lakshay Mohan and Aayush Mohan are dedicated to learn Indian Classical Music and preserve this rich tradition for the future generations. It is the outcome of this dedication that they have attained a high level of virtuosity and purity in their music and show an extraordinary command over their instruments. Their performances show a deep understanding of the intricacies of different ragas, which is rarely found in young musicians. Lakshay Mohan Gupta and Aayush Mohan Gupta have been learning Indian Classical Music for many years under eminent gurus such as Pt. Uma Shankar Mishra, Padmabhushan Smt. Sharan Rani, Pt. Balwant Rai Verma and Pt. Tejendra Narayan Majumdar. They have also taken training in Dhrupad ang from Padmashri Gundecha Brothers. Lakshay Mohan and Aayush Mohan have emerged as amongst the finest young musicians of the Maihar Gharana. Having developed an ingenious and deeply personal interpretation of their gharana's rich musical heritage, they produce aesthetically appealing music which reaches the depths of the hearts of listeners. After years of rigorous training and practice, Lakshay and Aayush have evolved their own unique style of playing jugalbandi and have won critical acclaim by connoisseurs as well as music critics. Reviews of their concerts have been published in leading national dailies like The Hindu, Dainik Bhaskar, Deccan Herald, Hindustan, Jansatta and The Asian Age. They were selected by the All India Radio to perform for a special broadcast on the occasion of the United Nations International Broadcasting Day. They have been awarded the Delhi Pratibha Puraskar by the Arts and Cultural Trust of India. After listening to their performance, music legend Pt. Jasraj hailed them as one of the most talented musicians of the younger generation. They have enthralled the audiences with their performances at prestigious classical music festivals and venues such as the Kamani Auditorium, India Habitat Center, New Delhi; Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Kolkata; All Bengal Music Conference , Kolkata ; Bharat Bhavan, Bhopal ; Durgiana Rag Sabha, Amritsar; RIMPA Festival 2012 held at The Ravi Shankar Centre, New Delhi.

Left wing banners are depicted on the viewer's right side, right wing on the left. According to statutes of the Ch'ing court, the ceremony of the Grand Review was to be held every three years. The first time under the Ch'ien-lung Emperor, who had assumed the throne in 1736, occurred in 1739. Archival records of the Ch'ing court at the time indicate that Chin K'un and other court artists were ordered to paint \"The Grand Review,\" a project that was completed in 1749. The final work was a set of four handscrolls, one each for \"The Imperial Encampment,\" \"Battle Formation Lined Up,\" \"Reviewing Battle Formation,\" and \"Battle Formation on the Move.\" At the end of each scroll are inscriptions by such top court officials as Liang Shih-cheng recording the contents of the paintings. Of the four, however, only two are known to survive--this one on loan from the Yageo Foundation and \"Battle Formation Lined Up\" in the Peking Palace Museum. The Ch'ien-lung Emperor is depicted here personally reviewing the troops, shown riding a horse and wearing martial attire. The painting style appears to follow the brushwork associated with Lang Shih-ning , the Jesuit court artist from Italy."}

Text Appearing Before Image: es,afterwards Queen Caroline, was Ranger of the Park,and resided in that house. It was discovered in 1890,vvhen a dilapidated summer-house was removed fromthe site. A doorway leading from the garden to thebath was bricked up, probably about the time thatthe house was pulled down in 1815. The sides of thebath and the steps leading to it were formerlycovered with small enamelled white tiles, the best ofwhich were utilised when repairing the buildingbefore the grounds were thrown open to the public.A lead pipe two inches in diameter conveyed waterto the bath, but, curious to say, there is no outlet, sothat the water must have been removed by pumping,as a small lead-lined, cup-shaped aperture at one ofthe corners would seem to indicate. The summer-house which stood over the bath was built ofrustic wood, with a slated roof, and seats aroundthe interior. Nearly opposite to the bath is a fort,or redoubt, which was made by H.R.H. The Dukeof Connaught when residing at the Rangers Lodgein 1863. Text Appearing After Image: GREENWICH CASTLE. II Greenwich Castle. The Castle, or Tower, which occupied a sitewhere the Royal Observatory now stands, was builtby Duke Humphrey in 1433, and repaired, or partlyrebuilt, by Henry VIII. This building would appearto have had four distinct phases of history. DukeHumphrey, in 1433, erected a square buttressedtower with a window facing the river, which HenryVIII., about 1500, rebuilt and added to, the additionsand alterations having extended over a period ofseveral years. About the beginning of the seventeenth century,Lord Northampton still further enlarged and beauti-fied the Castle, where he occasionally resided whenRanger of the Park. Sometimes the Castle was usedas a dwelling-place, sometimes as a prison, and atothers as a place of defence. Puttenham, in hisArt of English Poesie , says that HenryVIII., having Sir Andrew Flamock, standard-bearer,on his barge going from Westminster to Greenwichto visit a lady whom the King loved and lodged inthis Tower, on coming Note About Images Please note that these images are extracted from scanned page images that may have been digitally enhanced for readability - coloration and appearance of these illustrations may not perfectly resemble the original work."}

Domingo, the town's parish priest at that time. Envisioned as a school that will provide quality and ChristianCatholic educational formation to the young, it formally opened on June 1969 and offered kinder and grade one classes. The SAS educational system was placed under De La Salle supervision, and the impressive result of its first year operation convinced skeptics of the sincerity of its objectives and vision. From 44 pupils and two teachers, and succeeding school years saw the rapid growth of the school both in student environment and hired teachers.After only one year a primary building was built beside the left wing of the church. Then in 1971, construction of another building for the High School classrooms started. It was completed in 1972. The basketball court followed. Its first principal was Sr. Angeles Gabutina, AR, who served for two months, before Sr. Clemencia Ranin took over. When Sr. Ranin left, Sr. Matilde became the next principal in 1971. She stayed for two years, while Sr. Ma. Leonora served as elementary principal for SY 1972-1973. Then, in 1973-1976, Miss Patrocinio San Juan took over. The year 1975 also saw the retirement of Monsignor Francisco V. Domingo, both as town parish and school director. School Year 1975-1976 ushered in new administration for SAS. Fr. Luciano Paguiligan became the new director. Miss San Juan left, and in 1977, Fr. Corsie Legaspi took over her post. He stayed up to SY 1978-79.

The navy goatskin has been gold-tooled and inlaid with green, brown, and light blue goatskin in an almost cloisonn\u00e9-like style. The central nautical theme with fish and anchor, and the clamshell motif on the spine are apt reflections of the tale within, Voyage to the Spice Islands. The endleaves and pastedowns are of brown watered silk. Sangorski and Sutcliffe was a leading firm of craftsman binders founded in 1901 by Francis Sangorski and George Sutcliffe . Both had studied under Douglas Cockerell at London's Central School of Arts and Crafts. Sangorski and Sutcliffe's lavish use of coloured leathers, gold, and semi-precious stones, combined with innovative motifs, resulted in richly detailed bindings. Purchased by Alexander Turnbull.

Crime rate data per 100,000 women in this map is the broadest definition of crime against women under Indian law. It includes rape, sexual assault, insult to modesty, kidnapping, abduction, cruelty by intimate partner or relatives, trafficking, persecution for dowry, dowry deaths, indecency, and all other crimes listed in Indian Penal Code. English: The map shows crime rate trends against Dalits , against Women and against overall population in India from 2001 to 2011 period. The Indian government began tracking and reporting total crimes, crime by each category and crime rates per 100,000 against women and against Dalits as two separate chapters in Annual Crime Reports since the 1990s. The overall crimes and crime rate data has been tracked and reported in its Annual Crime Reports since 1953. Crime rate in this chart is the broadest definition of crime under Indian law reported by the data source. It includes all IPC and SLL crimes, such as murder, attempted murder, death by negligence, arson, kidnapping, injury, theft, robbery, rape, assault, sexual harassment, riots, civil rights violation, crime of atrocity, cruelty by intimate partner or relatives, importation or trafficking of girls, persecution for dowry, dowry deaths, indecency, gambling, trespassing, violating local laws, and all other crimes covered under national and state laws of India. Data Source: Incidence of Total Cognizable Crime 1953-2011, Compendium of Crime in India, National Crime Research Bureau , Union Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India . The data from the above single published report is also available electronically in individual annual crime reports from 2001 through 2011 here, under Publications tab, followed by Crime in India sub-tab. For cross country comparisons of violence/crime against women in India with rest of the world, see India Statistics, w:United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ; Crime victimization report by US Department of Justice, USA . Notes: The above chart plots the rate from the data source table, not the total number of crimes. The total number of crimes per year has risen, as has the total overall population, total Dalit population, and total number of women in India. The chart uses the Indian data source reporting basis of per \"lakh\" , rather than UNODC and US-DOJ basis of per thousand ."}

Charles Carroll Glover began his career in banking in 1866 as a teller at Riggs & Company. He was elevated to cashier in 1874, and president in 1896. The bank's co-founder was William W. Corcoran. Glover became one of the most important people in the development of Washington, D.C. He was director of the Washington and Georgetown Railroad, president of the Corcoran Gallery, and helped finish the Washington Monument. He purchased and consolidated all the land which currently forms Rock Creek Park and the National Zoo. When the federal government tired of buying this land from him, he donated the rest. In the 1880s, Glover demanded that the federal government dredge the Potomac River to stop the city from being repeatedly flooded. Rather than get rid of the sediment, Glover aruged that the city should up up the National Mall and create vast new parkland. Local business leaders said the new land should be a railroad yard. But Glover lobbied the President of the United States personally, and on Grover Cleveland's last day in office he signed legislation establishing the parkland. Instead of a railroad yard, Washington got the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials. Glover also pushed for the development of Massachusetts Avenue, and in 1928 donated the land at 3100 Massachusetts Avenue to the British government for the location of their new embassy -- establishing Embassy Row in the process. In 1924, Glover 77 acres of land to the city to form Glover-Archbold Park. It was at the home of Charles Carroll Glover at 734 Jackson Place that on December 8, 1891, a group of laymen and priests decided to build the Washington National Cathedral."}

Metamorphic minerals alter with the changing P-T condition with time without reaching complete phase equilibrium, making P-T-t path tracking possible. From 1910 Ma to 1840 Ma, the rock experienced an increase in P-T conditions and formed mineral garnet, which is attributed to burial and heating. After that, the rock was continuously heated to the peak temperature and formed mineral cordierite. Meanwhile, it went through a great decrease in pressure around 1840 Ma due to an uplift event. Finally, the continuous drop in pressure and temperature in 1800 Ma resulted from further erosion and exhumation. The peak pressure is found to be reached before the peak temperature, owing to the relatively poor thermal conductivity of the rock upon increasing P-T condition, while the rock instantaneously experienced the pressure changes. Garnet and cordierite do not reach complete equilibrium when discovered on the surface, leaving a print of the past P-T environments.

It was produced by combining the most high quality available peatland map from a wide variety of sources that describe peatland distributions at global, regional and national levels. The following sequence of comparisons to discriminate between overlapping data sources were used: Relevance. The most important criterion was that source data are able to identify peatlands faithfully and to distinguish them from other land cover types, especially non-peat forming wetlands. Spatial resolution. In areas where two or more overlapping data sources were indistinguishable in terms of their relevance to peatlands, the dataset with the finest spatial resolution was selected. Age. In any areas where two or more overlapping datasets were indistinguishable based on both their apparent relevance to peatlands and their spatial resolution, the data product that had been most recently updated was selected.

Es entstand 1864 zusammen mit einem Gewerbebau im Hof, einer Erweiterung eines 1831 erbauten Seitenfl\u00fcgels. Weitere Gewerbebauten wurden 1907 um weitere H\u00f6fe erbaut. Hier betrieb Otto Weidt von 1940 bis 1944 eine B\u00fcrstenbinderei, in der er Juden besch\u00e4ftigte und dadurch vor der Deportation bewahren konnte. Eine Gedenktafel in der Durchfahrt des Vorderhauses erinnert daran, dass das \"Haus Schwarzenberg\" eine St\u00e4tte des Widerstandes gegen den Nationalsozialismus ist. Heute befinden sich hier unter anderem das \"Anne Frank Zentrum Berlin\", das \"Kino Central\" und ein Museum in der ehemaligen Werkstatt Weidt. Der Komplex ist als Baudenkmal gelistet. English: Front building of the \"Haus Schwarzenberg\" at Rosenthaler Stra\u00dfe No. 39 in Berlin-Mitte. It was built in 1864 together with a rear workshop building, itself an extension of an older side wing dating back to 1831. Other workshop buildings on the large compound with several courts were added in 1907. From 1940 to 1944, Otto Weidt owned a workshop for manufacturing brooms and brushes here; he managed to protect several of his Jewish employees from deportation. A memorial plaque in the passage of the front building is a reminder that the building is a site of resistance against Nazism. Das \"Haus Schwarzenberg\" now houses the Anna Frank Zentrum Berlin, the \"Kino Central\" and a museum in Weidt's former workshop. The complex has been designated as a historic landmark."}

Logan has command of the post, and is fortifying it very strongly. \"The enemy is known to have a great desire to repossess the town, and an attack from them is momentarily expected.

They have as yet had but one occasion to use it, and that was at Henderson, a few days since, where the woods were shelled sufficiently to make it too hot to hold the rebels. At every trestle-work or bridge along the road are stationed a few soldiers as guard, and it is to this we owe our security as we go dashing along at a headlong pace.\""}

A Shortt-Synchronome free pendulum clock, the most accurate pendulum clock ever made, at the NIST museum, Gaithersburg, MD, USA. It kept time with two synchronized pendulums. The master pendulum in the vacuum tank swung free of virtually any disturbance, and controlled the slave pendulum in the clock case which performed the impulsing and timekeeping tasks. Its accuracy was about a second per year. Shortt clock in US National Institute of Standards and Technology museum, Gaithersburg, Maryland. This clock was purchased in 1929 and used in physicist Paul R. Heyl's measurement of the gravitational constant. On the left is the master pendulum in its vacuum tank. English: A Shortt-Synchronome free pendulum clock belonging to the US National Institute of Standards and Technology , in the NIST Museum, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA. Invented in 1921 by William Hamilton Shortt, it was the most accurate mechanical clock ever manufactured, achieving an accuracy of around one second per year. This example was purchased by NIST in 1929 and used by physicist Paul R. Heyl in his second determination of the gravitational constant. It consists of a master invar pendulum in a copper vacuum tank and a precision pendulum clock . The units are connected by electric wires that operate electromagnets to keep the slave pendulum in the clock synchronized to the master pendulum. The pendulum in the clock is attached to the clock's mechanism and performs the function of moving the clock's gears, leaving the master pendulum to swing virtually free of outside influence. The pendulums make one swing per second, and every 30 swings the slave clock gives the master pendulum a push to keep it swinging. Alterations to image: brightened slightly, changed from GIF to JPEG.

I saw him in a nearby pub beforehand and he was, as they say, \"steamin'\". You can just see in this photograph that there is blood on his face, presumably from an argument with a door frame or his manager. Whatever it was, he was very angry. For some reason, he seemed to have issues with Rory Gallagher that night. I can't imagine why, since Rory always came across as a true gentleman. I'm afraid John Martyn slipped a little in my ratings after this. Ah, the demon drink. Aside from that, he was still a great songwriter and innovative musician. To complete this lineup of oddities we had Ian Stewart on piano, Rick Wakeman on keyboards and Dick Heckstall-Smith on saxophone. I miss Rory Gallagher too."}

In troublous times with theIndians it was included in a system of signals maintained by thecolonists, and fires were built upon it, from which fact themountains derived their name.

A fragmented sauropod known from the holotype SGO-PV-961, found in the Atacama Desert. The preserved elements consist of: Right femur, the proximal end of a humerus, two dorsal vertebrae, posterior caudal vertebrae, dorsal ribs and a possibly fragmentary element of the sternum, other fragmented caudal vertebrae and indeterminate bones. Due to the fragmented nature of the holotype, most cladistic analyzes exclude Atacamatitan. Nevertheless, in 2012, Rubilar-Rogers and Gutstein conducted a preliminary cladistic analysis which placed Atacamatitan within the Lithostrotia. The original description lacks a lateral view for the humerus and femur, the lateral view for the humerus was based on Alamosaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia, since it shows resemblance with them. The lateral view of the femur is based on Mendozasaurus for the same reason. Color Key Known Unknown Espa\u00f1ol: Composici\u00f3n esquel\u00e9tica del titanosaurio chileno Atacamatitan chilensis.

Debido a la naturaleza fragmentada del holotipo, muchos an\u00e1lisis cladisticos excluyen a Atacamatitan.

As with the Ship and Pelican, on the opposite side of Church Street, this pub dates back to 1740. The only older buildings in Heavitree are ecclesiastical. Originally called the Horse and Jockey, the building was a popular refreshment-stop for many when walking to public executions at Ringswell. The pub was the first public house to be purchased, in 1891, by the newly incorporated Heavitree Brewery, which traded from Church Street. The public house was renamed 'The Heavitree' on 4th August 2006. The building to the right, with the double garage front, is now part of the public house. It used to house Exeter Fire Brigade's Heavitree District Fire Station. When the Danes Castle site opened in 1932 as the main Exeter Fire Station, this station, along with all other district stations was closed. The building then became Swanston's fruit and vegetable shop and then later, an extension of the pub. ."}

In the background is the original chapel, nuns' residence, and bell tower. English: St. Peter's Mission near Cascade, Montana, in the United States, circa 1887 shortly after construction of the boys' school and priests' residence. St. Peter's was founded by priests belonging to the Society of Jesus , a Roman Catholic men's religious order. It was established at Bird Tail Rock in 1871 after several previous locations were abandoned. Ursuline nuns joined the mission in October 1884 to assist in running the mission and teaching Native American children. In 1884, the mission consisted of two log buildings -- a chapel with a bell tower connected to a common sleeping area for priests, and a lower structure which consisted of a sleeping area for nuns and a kitchen. In 1887, private donations and a contract from the U.S. federal government to educate Native American chidren allowed the Jesuits to construct a three-story wood frame priests' residence. Attached to the residence was a four-story stone building with a mansard roof, dormers, and square cupola. The building contained dormitory space for male students, classrooms, a smithy, a cobbler shop, a carpentry shop, and a dining room. A kitchen garden was next to the building. The Jesuits abandoned St. Peter's Mission in 1898, moving their educational and missionary activities to St. Mary's Mission on the Piegan Blackfeet reservation to the north. The boys' school burned to the ground in 1907. St. Peter's Mission was abandoned when the Ursuline convent burned to the ground in 1918."}

{"id": "32fe102f-c862-310b-a12d-9b63ac090d8f", "title": "English: Willie Rosenstein was a World War I ace and a pre-war aviation pioneer. He was born in Stuttgart on January 28, 1892. Because he had a keen interest in engines and cars, he decided to become a motor engineer. In 1912 he earned his pilot's license at the famous flying school at Johannisthal. Soon afterwards he became a flight instructor, a test pilot, and a contestant in airplane competitions. His great flying talent made him nationally known. When war was declared in 1914, Rosenstein volunteered for duty as a pilot. At first he piloted two-seaters: while he flew the plane, another man would observe the enemy below. Later in the war the observers were armed with machine guns and participated in air combat. Pilots of one-seaters had both jobs of flying and shooting, and Rosenstein eventually became the pilot of a one-seater. From February to December 1917, Rosenstein was a member of Jasta 17, which was under the command of Lieutenant Hermann Goering. Rosenstein had his first confirmed aerial victory while in Jasta 17. In late 1917 an incident occurred in which Rosenstein became very upset after Lt. Goering made an anti-Semitic remark in front of several people; Rosenstein requested an apology but when Goering refused, Rosenstein asked for a transfer out of the unit. In Rosenstein's official assessment, Goering wrote that Rosenstein was a fine pilot but that he was suffering from nervous exhaustion, and for a short while Rosenstein was assigned border duty. He eventually was transferred to Jasta 40, led by Lt. Carl Degelow, and Rosenstein flourished under his command. Rosenstein shot down several more enemy aircraft and was even made Deputy Staffelf\u00fchrer . Rosenstein always received excellent assessments from Degelow. Rosenstein received credit for shooting down seven enemy aircraft , but he most probably deserved credit for two additional victories. His last two victories occurred near the end of the war and as a result, his claims were never officially processed. Among the decorations he received for his wartime service were the Iron Cross , the Order of the Zaringer Lion, and the W\u00fcrttemburg Service Medal in Gold."}

His birth name is Nigel John Dermot Neill. He was born in Northern Ireland, in Omagh, County Tyrone, the second son of Dermot Neill, a Harrow- and Sandhurst-educated British Army officer and third-generation New Zealander, and his English wife, Priscilla Beatrice. In 1954, Neill returned with his family to New Zealand, where he attended the Anglican boys' boarding school Christ's College in Christchurch. He then went on to study English literature at the University of Canterbury. Sam Neill started work at the National Film Unit before embarking on a successful acting career. He joined the NFU on January 31 1972 as a Production Trainee. He was promoted to Production Assistant in 1974 before becoming a Film Director in 1977. He left the Film Unit sometime before March 1979 . The National Film Unit was established to publicise New Zealand's participation and achievements during the Second World War. After 1945 the NFU expanded from producing weekly newsreels to making documentaries and films to the order of Government Departments. During its existence the NFU produced films for national organisations as well as many films on its own initiative. The private film industry in New Zealand relied heavily on the National Film Unit's extensive film processing facilities. Sam's first film was Landfall \u2013 A Film About Ourselves produced by the National Film Unit. These stills are from the original 35mm stills held by Archives New Zealand. He later went on to achieve huge success with Hollywood blockbusters such as Jurassic Park. He also runs a vineyard in Queenstown called Two Paddocks - _URL_ His full filmography can be found here: _URL_ Reference: AAPG W3939 Box 28 _URL_.do?code=24290091 For more information email Research.Archives@dia.govt.nz For updates on our On This Day series and news from Archives New Zealand, follow us on Twitter _URL_"}

In the Punnett square to the left, two heterozygous individuals can potentially form three types of offspring: homozygous positive, heterozygous carriers and homozygous negative, in the ratio of 1:2:1. Homozygous positive offspring will completely express the particular recessive trait, in this case the genetic disorder. In the Punnett square to the right, a heterozygous carrier individual and a homozygous negative individual can potentially form two types of offspring: heterozgous carriers and homozygous negative, in the ratio of 1:1, and are necessarily unable to produce any affected offspring, barring a new random mutation. It is the situation depicted on the left, in which couples have the potential of producing affected offspring, that Dor Yeshorim attempts to prevent."}
